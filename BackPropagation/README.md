# Back propagation method

## note

You can edit `ROW` means œÅ, `EPOCH` means how many times it learn,

and Neural Network architecture.

In Neural Network archtecutre, 

you can change Networks list.

For example, you want to forth layer network:

```
Networks = [3, 3, 4, 5]
```

first argment means the number of input layer.

Second, third,...Nth argment mean the number of hidden layer.

Last layer means the number of output layer.
